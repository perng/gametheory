<h1>About</h1>

<p>Websocket Chatroom is an online chatroom for people to communicate and socialize.</p>

<p>With a small but powerful set of console commands provided,
people can freely create new chatrooms (and thus become room master), 
set it as public or private, set its max size, join and invite people
to join. Multiple login is allowed.
People can see what rooms are online, all the users online and who are in their current chatroom. They can
change personal settings in the settings panel, including sound and background image options.</p>

<p>Besides chatting people can also play games. At this time one game (6-piece chess) is available.</p>


<h1>Privacy</h1>

<p>
People are suggested not to disclose any sensitive personal information online.
</p>


<h1>Features to come</h1>

<p>
In the long run, these features could be included:
</p>
<ul>
