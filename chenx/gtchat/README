== About ==

This package is a chatroom implemented using using python/autobahn/twisted websocket. 

This is extended from the previous broadcastdemo package, and will be a testing client for the gametheory server. 
The concept is to build a simplified and specific server, and a fully functioning client based on this. The client
can can be used to test the more complex and generic gametheory server.

Basically, it's a chatroom: when server is started, a client can connect to the server and join a room,
then send message to all other clients. 

This can be easily extended to other multi-user games, from 2 players to any number of players.


== Server API ==

Communication is done in Json. 

No persistence is used at this time, user data is cached in memory.

commands: register, login, update_pwd, create_room, invite, join_room, leave_room, speak

-- register
{"cmd":"register","usr":"username","pwd":"password"}

Password should be at least 8 chars in length.

-- login
{"cmd":"register","usr":"username","pwd":"password"}

-- update_pwd
{"cmd":"update_pwd", "usr":"username", "pwd":"old_pwd", "new_pwd":"pwd", "new_pwd2":"pwd"}

-- create_room

-- invite

-- join_room

-- leave_room

-- speak

Examples:

{"cmd":"register","usr":"user1","pwd":"pwd1abcd"}
{"cmd":"register","usr":"user2","pwd":"pwd1efgh"}
{"cmd":"update_pwd", "usr":"user1", "pwd":"pwd1abcd", "new_pwd":"12345678", "new_pwd2":"12345678"}
{"cmd":"login", "type":"reg", "usr":"user2","pwd":"pwd1efgh"}
{"cmd":"login", "type":"tmp", "usr":"user2"}

== Client API ==


== Code ==

client.py and server.py are from:
[1] https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython/tree/master/examples/twisted/websocket/broadcast
[2] http://autobahn.ws/python/websocket/examples.html

client.html is from:
[3] https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython/blob/master/examples/twisted/websocket/echo/client.html

Modified client.py to add the function of getting console stdio input from user.
Modified server.py to avoid sending to self when broadcast, and added class API_Chatroom.
