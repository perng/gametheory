Broadcast example

== About ==

This package demonstrate python/autobahn/twisted broadcasting. 

Basically, it's like a chatroom: when server is started, a client can connect to the server,
and send message to all other clients. There is no limit of clients.

== Code ==

client.py and server.py are from:
[1] https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython/tree/master/examples/twisted/websocket/broadcast
[2] http://autobahn.ws/python/websocket/examples.html

client.html is from:
[3] https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython/blob/master/examples/twisted/websocket/echo/client.html

Modified client.py to add the function of getting console stdio input from user.
Modified server.py to avoid sending to self when broadcast.
Modified client.html to add the textbox for user input. Also modified output format.

== Usage ==

Right now this package runs locally, connect to localhost (127.0.0.1).
It can be easily changed to use remotely, by changing the host.

To start server:
$ python server.py

To start client:
$ python client.py

To start client.html in a browser:
open client.html in a browser.

To exit console server or client, press Ctrl-C.
