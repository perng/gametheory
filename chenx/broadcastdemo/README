== About ==

This package demonstrate broadcasting using python/autobahn/twisted websocket. 

Basically, it's a chatroom: when server is started, a client can connect to the server,
and send message to all other clients. There is no limit on the number of clients.

This can be easily extended to other multi-user games, from 2 players to any number of players.

== Code ==

client.py and server.py are from:
[1] https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython/tree/master/examples/twisted/websocket/broadcast
[2] http://autobahn.ws/python/websocket/examples.html

client.html is from:
[3] https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython/blob/master/examples/twisted/websocket/echo/client.html

Modified client.py to add the function of getting console stdio input from user.
Modified server.py to avoid sending to self when broadcast.
Modified client.html to add the textbox for user input, and modified output format.

== Usage ==

Right now this package runs locally, connect to localhost port 9000 (127.0.0.1:9000).
It can be easily changed to be used remotely, by changing the host and port values.

To start server:
$ python server.py

To start client:
$ python client.py

To exit server or client from console, press Ctrl-C.

To start client.html in a browser:
open client.html in a browser.
